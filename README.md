## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Every morning I like to start by streching and solving a puzzle. CodeWars is one of my favorite ways to begin the day. Solving problems.


## Optimizations:

Every challenge (kata) encourages me to recognize patterns or think outside the box. It is a habit of mine to refractor, optimize, and comment my solutions. Sometimes for efficiency and sometimes for readability

## Lessons Learned:

It is consistency that always pushes me to stay curious and learn. Tackling a new kata in the mornings helps me get my mind in a balance place.
