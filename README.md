A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Pushing over 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Every morning the first thing I do is stretch and solve a puzzle!


## Optimizations:

Every challenge (kata) encourages me to recognize patterns or think outside the box. It is a habit of mine to refractor, optimize, and comment my solutions. Sometimes for efficiency and sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

It is consistency that always pushes me to stay curious and learn. Tackling a new kata in the mornings helps me understand there is always a new thing to learn.
