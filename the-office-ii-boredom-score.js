//7 Kyu
//The Office II - Boredom Score
//Fundamentals, arrays

// Every now and then people in the office moves teams or departments. Depending what people are doing with their time they can become more or less boring. Time to assess the current team.

// You will be provided with an object(staff) containing the staff names as keys, and the department they work in as values.

// Each department has a different boredom assessment score, as follows:

// accounts = 1
// finance = 2
// canteen = 10
// regulation = 3
// trading = 6
// change = 6
// IS = 8
// retail = 5
// cleaning = 4
// pissing about = 25

// Depending on the cumulative score of the team, return the appropriate sentiment:

// <=80: 'kill me now'
// < 100 & > 80: 'i can handle this'
// 100 or over: 'party time!!'


//Solution


function boredom(staff){
//set up a variable to track the team score
  let score = 0
//set up an object to store each department name as the key and the score as the value
  let depScore = {
    "accounts": 1,
    "finance": 2,
    "canteen": 10,
    "regulation": 3,
    "trading": 6,
    "change": 6,
    "IS": 8,
    "retail": 5,
    "cleaning": 4,
    "pissing about": 25
  }
//loop through the keys in object and use the value to add the department score to the result variable
  for(member in staff){
    if(depScore[staff[member]]){
      score+=depScore[staff[member]]
    }
  }
  console.log(score)
//evaluate the score and return the appropriate msg
  if(score>80 && score<100){
    return 'i can handle this'
  }else if(score<=80){
    return 'kill me now'
  }else{
    return 'party time!!'
  }
}

//obj -> staff names as keys, department as values, 

//str -> a str msg based on the score of the team. 
// <=80: 'kill me now'
// < 100 & > 80: 'i can handle this'
// 100 or over: 'party time!!'
